# Class Features
You gain these abilities as a [class name]. Abilities gained at higher levels list the level at which you gain them next to the features' names.

## Ancestry and background
In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background, as described in Chapter 2 of the *Core Rulebook*.

## Initial Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.

## Skill Feats 2nd
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats are listed in Chapter 5 of the Core Rulebook and have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.


## [Class Name] Feats 2nd
At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a [class name] class feat.

## General Feats 3rd
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5 of the *Core Rulebook*.


<!-- Column break -->
|

## Skill Increases 3rd
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you’re already trained.

At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you’re already a master.

## Ability Boosts 5th
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.

## Ancestry Feats 5th
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry’s entry in Chapter 2 of the *Core Rulebook*.
