# Scribe PF2 Templates
Welcome!

This repository serves as a collection of Scribe PF2 Templates that I created to ease homebrew content for Pathfinder 2E. Hopefully these templates ease the process of developing archetypes you may have. I plan to create more templates, so feel free to bookmark this!

## How to Use
Go to the 'Templates' Folder and select the MD file for the template you wish to use. Copy the code from the file to your Scribe PF2 editor window on the web application. It will render the template on the display window.

## Have Suggestions?
If you have any suggestions on improving these templates or trouble using them, let me know by leaving a remark in the Issues section.
